<p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

<ol>
  <li>Can understand what is going on under the hood </li>
  <li>Not have to rely on someone else for a quick prototype website</li>
  <li>it's fun!</li>
</ol>

<div class="contrast">
<h2> <i>What do you need to create a website? </i></h2>

<p> Not much!</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML is cool</li>
  <li id="lower">CSS is cooler</li>
  <li id="lowest">JS is the best</li>
</ul>
